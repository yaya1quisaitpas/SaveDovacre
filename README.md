# 🕹️ SaveDovacre

> A retro-style C++ text adventure game inspired by *Colossal Cave Adventure*, made for my favorite TikToker — Dovacre!

---

## 🎮 Concept

**SaveDovacre** is a minimalist text-based adventure game where you wake up in a dark, cold room at coordinate **(1,1)**. Your goal? Navigate the dungeon, survive the unknown, and find **Dovacre**, the most legendary TikToker of all time, who has mysteriously vanished...

Made for fun, in just two days!
